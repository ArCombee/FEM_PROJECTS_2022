## About the author (me)

My name is Arjen Combee and I'm what I call an **Enthusiastic Junior Developer hobbyist**. When I have some spare time I really like to make websites or components, just for fun.
I like to learn the modern way of coding, all by hand and as vanilla as possible.

## Acknowledgments

Big shout-out to some people who really inspired me to lean web development. They are the reason why I joined [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to get better in coding and have a fun time doing so.
